    /// The ToolConsumerProfile (and all of its members) conform to JSON-LD conventions. Briefly, JSON-LD adds 
    /// semantics to a JSON document by associating properties that may appear in a document with well-defined 
    /// data types through the use of a so-called "context".
    /// 
    /// The JSON-LD standard reserves a handful of property names and tokens that have special meaning. These 
    /// names and tokens, described below, begin with the '@' symbol.
    /// 
    /// @context - Used to reference (by URI or by value) a context which declares the simple names that appear 
    /// throughout a JSON document.
    /// 
    /// @id - Used to uniquely identify things that are being described in the JSON document. The value of an 
    /// @id property is either a fully-qualified URI, a CURIE, or a simple name that expands to a fully-qualified 
    /// URI by virtue of the rules defined in the JSON-LD Context.
    /// 
    /// @type - Used to set the data type of an object or property value.
